# Towards More Human-like bots in FPS Bots
This work is primarily based on VizDoom(https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom). 
You need to have it installed to run basic/learning_basid.py and complex/learning_complex.py.
You also need to have python and pytorch if you haven't installed them already.
If you encounter any problem running the scripts, refer to the above VizDoom github page for more help.
